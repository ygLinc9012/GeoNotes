# Dirac Sphere
The cited paper introduces the discretization of Dirac operator. When applying the operator to a sphere, the eigenfunctions correspond to relativistic wave functions of an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus. This code applies Dirac operator to a sphere and visualize its eigenfunctions, also called Dirac sphere.
