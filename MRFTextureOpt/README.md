# Markov Random Field Energy for Texture Optimization
This method is based on the section 3 of the cited paper. Markov Random Field energy model is wildely used for texture synthesis. This demo code is a simple implementation of the texture synthesis process. To make it easy to understand, it is implemented for gray-scale images.
