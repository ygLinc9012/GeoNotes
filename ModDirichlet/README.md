# Modified Dirichlet Energy Operator
The Laplace operator (in ../CotanLaplace) is built based on Dirichlet energy. It can detect purely intrinsic geometric properties. On the other hand, Laplace can not "see" extrinsic features of the shape. Therefore, the cited paper introduces the modified Dirichlet energy which allows the proposed operator to detech both intrinsic and extrinsic shape properties.
